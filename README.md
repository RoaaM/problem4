# Image Statistics

you can run this code on visual studio by download this repo and open it in visual studio.

This C# code defines a class called ImageStatistics that contains a method called Calculate that takes a Bitmap object as input and returns a tuple of four values that represent the statistics of the input image.

The four values in the tuple are:

mean: the mean gray value of all the pixels in the image

stdDev: the standard deviation of the gray values of all the pixels in the image

minGrayValue: the minimum gray value of all the pixels in the image

maxGrayValue: the maximum gray value of all the pixels in the image

The method first calculates the dimensions of the input image, then initializes variables to store the sum of gray values, the squared sum of gray values, the minimum gray value, and the maximum gray value of all pixels in the image. It then loops through every pixel in the image, extracts the gray value of each pixel, updates the variables accordingly, and calculates the final statistics using the formulas for mean and standard deviation.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to calculate basic statistics of a grayscale image, such as mean and standard deviation.
